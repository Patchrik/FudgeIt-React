## Why Am I Building This?
### The Problem

According to Money Crashers, the number 1 reason that a budget fails is that it’s unrealistic, and one of the reasons that your budget might be unrealistic is because you really don’t know how much money you’re spending. Because of this your budget is probably too small for you, this can lead you to go over budget and become demoralized. You can try to use other budgeting and money tracking apps but many give a user too much information. Leading to paralysis by analysis.

### The Solution

Once you know what you are spending the exercise of budgeting becomes easier. But how do we track our expenses when the big apps give us too much info or want to sell our data? Well, that’s where Fudge It comes in, Fudge It is a simple-to-use lightweight expense tracking app that does one thing well. Making it easy to track and see where your money is going.
